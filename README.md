# Movie-ratings-server

The movie ratings prediction server predicts the rating (5-star rating) of a movie based on a text input, i.e. the review.
Python and Flask have been used to run the server and to let the server interact with the user. The frontend has been designed using
basic HTML and Bootstrap.
